DESIGN PATTERN

    MVP with Passive View and Presentation Model
    - make it easier to separate certain responsibilities of the app, easy to read/trace/expand and make it much easier to maintain the code as a whole.
    note: It requires solid knowledge of MVP pattern


FOLDER STRUCTURE

    The folder structure is based on re-usability, e.g. Model classes

    *feature folder, why?
        - A feature is a prominent characteristic or something added as a special attraction.
        One product has many features which we can generally separate into two groups:
        the different things it can do, and the different UI attractions.
        example the login feature or landing page feature
